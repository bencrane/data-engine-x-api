# System Overview: data-engine-x-api

Comprehensive documentation of the system as of 2026-02-22. Written for AI agents or human engineers who need full context to continue development.

## What This System Is

`data-engine-x-api` is a multi-tenant entity intelligence pipeline. It takes company domains, carrier DOT numbers, permit IDs, or person identifiers as input, runs them through configurable sequences of enrichment, research, and discovery operations, and produces structured, persisted intelligence as output.

The system supports multiple product surfaces on the same infrastructure:
- **CRM Enrichment**: Client gives their data → system cleans/enriches/scores → returns it better
- **Outbound Intelligence**: Define a target segment → discover companies and people → get contact info → output is campaign-ready
- **Trigger-Based Outbound**: Government filings (FMCSA, building permits, bankruptcy) detected as buying signals → enrich → contact → outbound
- **Market Intelligence**: Geographic analytics for construction, trucking, and ecommerce verticals

## Architecture

### Execution Flow

```
Client → POST /api/v1/batch/submit
  → Creates submission + pipeline runs (one per entity)
  → Triggers Trigger.dev run-pipeline task per run
    → Runner reads blueprint snapshot
    → For each step:
      → Evaluates condition (skip if not met)
      → Checks entity freshness (skip if recent data exists)
      → Derives entity_type from operation_id prefix
      → Calls POST /api/v1/execute on FastAPI (internal HTTP)
      → FastAPI routes to operation service → provider waterfall
      → Result merges into cumulative context
      → If fan_out step: creates child runs (recursive — nested fan-out supported)
        → Child runs execute remaining steps per fan-out entity
    → On completion: captures entity snapshot → upserts entity state → writes timeline events
  → Client polls POST /api/v1/batch/status for results (recursive tree display)
  → Client queries POST /api/v1/entities/* for accumulated intelligence
  → Client checks POST /api/v1/coverage/check for data readiness
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Output Chaining (Cumulative Context):** Each step's canonical output is shallow-merged into a cumulative context dict. Subsequent steps read from this context.

**Fan-Out (Nested):** A step marked `fan_out: true` that returns a `results` array creates child pipeline runs — one per result. Child runs can themselves fan-out, creating grandchild runs. Recursive to arbitrary depth.

**Conditional Step Execution:** Steps can include a `condition` in `step_config` evaluated against cumulative context. Supports: `exists`, `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`, `contains`, `icontains`, `in`, plus `all` (AND) and `any` (OR) logical groups. Skipped steps don't fail the run.

**Entity Deduplication:** Two levels — within a batch (fan-out dedup by identifier) and across batches (freshness check against entity state with `skip_if_fresh` in step_config).

**Entity State Accumulation:** Completed pipeline runs upsert canonical entity records. Upserts are additive — non-null overwrites, null preserves. Identity resolution is deterministic via UUIDv5 from natural keys.

**Entity Snapshots:** Before each entity upsert, the previous state is captured as an append-only snapshot. Enables change detection ("employee_count went from 50 to 65").

### Entity Relationships

The `entity_relationships` table records typed, directional relationships between entities. Each relationship has a source entity (identified by domain or LinkedIn URL), a relationship type (e.g., `has_customer`, `has_competitor`, `works_at`, `alumni_of`), and a target entity. Relationships are org-scoped, deduplicated on (source, relationship, target), and support invalidation for time-bounded facts like employment.

Internal endpoints: `/api/internal/entity-relationships/record`, `/record-batch`, `/invalidate`.
Query endpoint: `/api/v1/entity-relationships/query`.

**Entity Timeline:** Append-only log per entity capturing every step execution — which operation ran, which provider succeeded, which fields were updated, skip reasons. Queryable per entity, per run, or per submission.

**Operation Registry + AI Blueprint Assembler:** Formal metadata for all operations (inputs, outputs, cost tier, fan-out support). AI endpoint assembles blueprints from natural language or field checklists using Claude → OpenAI → Gemini fallback chain.

**Coverage Check:** Pre-outbound readiness assessment — "do I have enough enriched data for this prospect's TAM?"

## What's Not Built Yet

- **Blueprint auto-chaining** — automatic submission of next blueprint when current completes (Blueprint 1 → 2 → 3 hands-off)
- **Person enrichment from Sales Nav URLs** — resolve hashed LinkedIn URLs to canonical `/in/username` format for Prospeo/LeadMagic enrichment
- **Entity relationship wiring** — record customer/alumni/works_at relationships during pipeline execution
- **Output delivery** — push results to CRM, campaign tool, webhook, CSV
- **Input ingestion** — CRM pull, CSV upload validation, auto-derived input requirements
- **Bright Data connector** — automated puller/webhook to ingest Indeed + LinkedIn snapshots from Bright Data API (tables + ingestion endpoints exist in HQ, connector not wired)
- **Cross-source job matching automation** — scheduled comparison of TheirStack job postings against Bright Data to auto-update `posting_status`
- **Page content extraction** — scraping G2/pricing pages for structured intelligence
- **Google Maps scrape + owner identification** — for local/SMB lead gen
- **Website scrape for owner detection** — LLM-based owner identification from scraped content
- **Scheduled monitoring** — cron-based change detection triggers
- **FMCSA daily changes wired into data-engine-x** — endpoint exists in `ongoing-data-pulls`, needs provider adapter in data-engine-x

## Operational Notes

- **Deploy flow**: `git push origin main` → Railway auto-deploys. Trigger.dev: `cd trigger && npx trigger.dev@latest deploy`. Modal: `cd modal && modal deploy app.py`.
- **Migrations**: Run manually via `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f supabase/migrations/0XX_*.sql`.
- **Key management**: All secrets in Doppler. Railway reads via `DOPPLER_TOKEN` + Dockerfile `doppler run`. Trigger.dev has its own env vars.
- **Verticals covered**: B2B SaaS, Ecommerce, Trucking, Construction, Legal/Risk, Revenue Intelligence, Staffing
